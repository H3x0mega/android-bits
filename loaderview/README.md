# LoaderView
The LoaderView shows an indeterminate ```ProgressBar``` while you load content on the background. This view lets you handle the failure and success scenarios of the loading process by showing a friendly error message (with a 'Try Again' button), or by removing the view completely.

### Features
- A retry action callback
- A queue for the fade transition animations, in order to avoid them overlapping
- Customizable messages, colors and drawables that can be set programmatically or in your XML layout

Please check the [sample app](https://github.com/H3x0mega/android-bits) at the android-bits repository to learn how the LoaderView works!
