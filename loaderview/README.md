# LoaderView
The LoaderView shows an indeterminate ```ProgressBar``` while you load content on the background. This view lets you handle the failure and success scenarios of the loading process by showing a friendly error message that lets you try again, or by removing the view completely.

Please check the [sample app](https://github.com/H3x0mega/android-bits) at the android-bits repository to check how the LoaderView works!
